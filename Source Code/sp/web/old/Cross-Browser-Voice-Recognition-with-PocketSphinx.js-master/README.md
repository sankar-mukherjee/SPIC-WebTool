How To Run
---

This needs to be run on a server. If you're on OS X try [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info). If you want to use something Node based I recomend [Serve](https://www.npmjs.org/package/serve).

---

If you use MAMP point your server to the directory you downloaded this Git repo to. 

To do this open your MAMP preferences and click the "Apache" tab. 

Then change your document root. 

Lastly, point your browser to `localhost:8888` to view the demo.

---

If you use Server simply `cd` to the directory you downloaded this Git repo to. 

Then type `serve` into your terminal.

Lastly, point your browser to `localhost:3000` to view the demo.
